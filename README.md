# DS-Assignment-9 Description

In this notebook, I am implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification model to predict iris species using the well-known Iris dataset. The notebook first loads and inspects the dataset using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data visualization. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection`. The main part of the code involves evaluating the model performance for different values of *k* (number of neighbors) in the k-NN algorithm. I run the model for a range of k values (from approximately the square root of the dataset length) and plot the accuracy for each. The model’s accuracy is calculated using the `KNeighborsClassifier` class from `sklearn.neighbors`, and I present the results through visualizations like line plots and correlation matrices. Finally, the classification report is displayed to provide deeper insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for the model’s performance with the selected optimal value of *k*. The Python features used in this project include data manipulation with `pandas`, statistical analysis with `numpy`, and model evaluation using `sklearn`'s machine learning and metrics tools.
